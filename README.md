# snvcpy
Unification of tools (scrcpy, sndcpy, autoadb) to stream your mobile phone video and audio to your computer via USB or WI-FI using some simple scripts. None of these tools are developed by me, i just wrapped these in a way that i thought that looks comfortable to use.

## Why?
I just wanted an easy and simple way of connecting my android device to my computer quickly.

## Requirements
These are the base requirements for using the applications:
### scrcpy:
  - At least Android 5.0 (API 21)
  - ADB debbuging enabled
### sndcpy:
  - At least Android 10
  - VLC Player

## Credits / Original projects
These projects are the core of this application, you should (if you haven't yet) check out and follow them.
