# snvcpy
Collection of tools to stream your mobile phone video and audio to your computer via USB or WI-FI. None of these tools are developed by me, i just wrapped these around in a way that i thought that looks comfortable to use.

### > Why?
I just wanted an easy and simple way of connecting my android device to my computer quickly.

### > Credits / Original projects
These projects are the core of this application, you should (if you haven't yet) check out and follow them.
